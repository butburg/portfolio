# Portfolio

Website with mainly HTML, CSS and Hugo to represent me in the www.

The website should make relevant information about my work and me easily recognizable. 
The design requirement is to offer two variants, one simple without strong styling and one with beautiful CSS and effects.

This repository contains files for my personal website.

It is also used to try Hugo in combination with github, which many recommended to me.
